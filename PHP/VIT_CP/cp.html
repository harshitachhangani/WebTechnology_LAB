      <h3>Software Development Project (SDP)</h3>
      <p> The Software Development Project (SDP) at VIT plays a crucial role in bridging theoretical knowledge with practical application. Through SDP, students engage in real-world software development scenarios, collaborating in teams to design, implement, and deploy software solutions. This hands-on experience not only sharpens technical skills but also cultivates teamwork, project management, and problem-solving abilities. SDP projects often mirror industry practices, providing students with a taste of the challenges and complexities inherent in professional software development..</p>

      <h3>Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI)</h3>
      <p>The Engineering Design and Innovation (EDI) projects at VIT emphasize the integration of engineering principles with innovative thinking. Students undertaking EDI projects delve into the entire product development lifecycle, from ideation and conceptualization to prototyping and testing. These projects encourage a holistic approach to problem-solving, fostering creativity and the ability to design solutions that are not only technically sound but also address real-world needs. EDI projects thus prepare students to be forward-thinking engineers capable of contributing to advancements in technology and industry.</p>
